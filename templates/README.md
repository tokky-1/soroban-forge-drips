# Contract templates

Each subdirectory is a template consumable by `soroban-forge new --template <name>`.
Owned by Module 2 (scaffolding) — see [`crates/scaffold`](../crates/scaffold)
for the template format and how to add a new one.

Manifests are shipped as `Cargo.toml.hbs` so cargo doesn't treat these
directories as packages; the `.hbs` suffix is stripped when a project is
generated.

Each template also carries a `template.toml` (description, any extra
prompted variables, post-generate hints) — see
[`crates/scaffold`](../crates/scaffold) for the format. It is metadata only
and is never copied into the generated project.
